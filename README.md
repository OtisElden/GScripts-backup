Here lie the remenants of my first true project. This was deisgned as a system for taking in user submitted google form data and evaluating/storing in databases. The project has taken many turns over the years and I've learned a literal metric ton from it. All in all, easily over 1000 hours of production time put into this.
You'll find some functions that are work in progress, most of them are finished. This really is the library for all other functions to run from. In the end this ran dynamic updates to form questions based on sheet data changes and stored and seperated data into different databases. 
Unfortanatley I was unable to come up with a way to implement a public facing auth system with redundancy that was also easy for crews wihtout the use of a google account. If anyone manages to stumble in on this and knows of a way to do all of this and also setup a auth with a different service please message me!.

The project solution that was chosen was a linked 365 account spreadsheet. It's a very rough solution IMO but it works.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. This was a project very near and dear to my heart. Please take whatever pieces of code you can from this and tweak it to your needs.
